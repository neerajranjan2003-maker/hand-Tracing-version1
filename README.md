# hand-Tracing-version1
Hand Tracking using OpenCV &amp; MediaPipe A real-time hand tracking project that uses a webcam to detect hands and draw hand landmarks using OpenCV and MediaPipe. Useful for learning computer vision basics and gesture-based applications


📌 Features

Real-time hand detection using webcam

Draws 21 hand landmarks and connections

Supports detection of multiple hands

Beginner-friendly and easy to understand

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

MediaPipe

📦 Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
